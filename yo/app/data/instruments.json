Since April 1998, HiPr has been available to the general ISIS user community, forming part of the CLRC high pressure diffraction programme. The application of high pressure can induce dramatic changes in the physical properties of condensed matter. For example, upon applying a modest pressure of ~2.5 GPa (25 kbar) water transforms to a crystal structure (phase VII) that does not melt until 100¿C. High pressure studies of condensed matter can provide fundamental information concerning the density dependence of interatomic interactions. However, until a decade ago, high-pressure neutron diffraction studies were confined to the rather limited pressure range 0-3 GPa. The development of the Paris-Edinburgh pressure cell for use at ISIS has now extended this range by almost a full order of magnitude up to ~25 GPa. The recently completed PEARL High Pressure Station (HiPr) - funded by the EPSRC and constructed as a result of a close collaboration between the University of Edinburgh, the University of Paris VI and ISIS - is a high-flux medium resolution diffractometer specifically designed to take full advantage of the capabilities of the Paris-Edinburgh cell.

The strengths of POLARIS lie in the rapid characterisation of structures, the study of small amounts of materials (as little as ~1mm3), the collection of data sets in rapid time (with data collection times down to ~5 minutes) and the studies of materials under non-ambient conditions, where the ability of time-of-flight powder diffraction to collect an entire diffraction pattern at a single, fixed scattering angle is a very powerful attribute. In particular, detector banks at 2q ~ 90¿ allow studies of samples within complex sample environment equipment, such as high pressure cells or reaction vessels, where suitable collimation of the incident and scattered beams eliminates contamination of the diffraction pattern by Bragg peaks from the cell components. The uniquely high flux of epithermal neutrons available at a spallation neutron source enable extremely short d-spacings, as low as 0.3 ¿ to be measured on POLARIS. The very wide Q range thus accessed is invaluable in the refinement of site occupancies and temperature factors in disordered materials, such as solid electrolytes and high Tc superconductors, using powder diffraction data. More routinely, POLARIS has also been used in structural studies of zeolites, for real time in situ studies of structural changes in industrially important materials such as batteries and toughened ceramics, and has been instrumental in allowing the development of high pressure powder neutron diffraction to 25 GPa and beyond.\"",

This makes SXD especially powerful in applications involving surveys of reciprocal space, such as phase transitions and incommensurate structures, and also in applications where sample orientation may be restricted. Applications of SXD have included routine structural studies and diffuse scattering. The structure determination programme reflects the strength of single crystal neutron diffraction in studies of non-bonded contacts, specifically those involving hydrogen atoms, thermal parameter analysis, and in the area of charge density studies where neutron diffraction data provide complementary information to high resolution X-ray studies. A recent innovation has resulted from exploitation of the flexible data collection method offered by the time-of-flight Laue technique, which allows data sets to be collected in relatively short periods of time. The ability to measure a structure at more than one temperature can have significant benefits, either to characterise thermal parameter behaviour (methyl group librations in paracetamol) or to study disorder (proton transfer in benzoic acid). Diffuse scattering caused by both dynamic and static effects can be studied, allowing short range structure, defect structure and local orientational correlations to be probed. A major area of interest is in developing methods to allow the Bragg and diffuse scattering to be used together in an integrated way to give a full picture of the structure under study. Much of the potential of SXD has been realised since the installation of a second position- sensitive detector, which increased the volume of reciprocal space accessed and hence the data collection rate. Recently, in October 1999, a grant of ¿1million was awarded by EPSRC to upgrade the SXD detectors. This will allow the provision of a total of 11 detectors, almost completely surrounding the sample position. These are scheduled to be installed during spring 2001.\"",
