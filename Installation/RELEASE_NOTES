Added table ICAT_AUTHENTICATION:
Column ID is a unique id 
Column AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE_URL is the URL of the authentication service,
 maybe null, i.e. the CAS server
Column AUTHENTICATION_TYPE is the mnemonic as used by the corresponding ICAT 
Column PLUGIN_NAME if the name of the topcat plugin to use, if null the default
 plugin will be used, which provides a user name and password
Column SERVER_ID is the id of the ICAT server as defined in the table
 TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER
Now when logging in to an ICAT if there is more than one type of authentication
 available the user will be presented with a drop down list of types
 
NB there is still stuff hard coded for CAS and entries for
AUTHENTICATION_SERVICE_URL and AUTHENTICATION_TYPE in the table
TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER. These will be removed in a future release.

NB There have been additions to the database. The column TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER has
been add to the table TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER and the table TOPCAT_USER_DOWNLOAD is
a new table.

This version contains updates for the new download service. You can now specify
the download service that the facility uses. This is done via an entry in the
TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER table which is set via the initialise_topcat_db.sql script.
If the DOWNLOAD_PLUGIN_NAME field is left blank the existing download mechanism
is used. A value of 'restfulDownload' indicates that the new restful download
service should be used.
