NB There have been additions to the database. The column TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER has been add to the table TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER
and the table TOPCAT_USER_DOWNLOAD is a new table.

This version contains updates for the new download service. You can now specify the download service that the
facility uses. This is done via an entry in the TOPCAT_ICAT_SERVER table which is set via the initialise_topcat_db.sql
script. If the DOWNLOAD_PLUGIN_NAME field is left blank the existing download mechanism is used. A value of 
'restfulDownload' indicates that the new restful download service should be used.
